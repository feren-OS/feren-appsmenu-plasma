One thing regarding kickoff is there probably shouldn't be any big changes before the release
Since the mockups were pretty strong is the first place and changing the UI would muddy the feedback (and we really want concrete feedback for this kind of change)

So basically:

    - get the feedback from 5.21 release
    - act on it instead trying to do something ourselves
